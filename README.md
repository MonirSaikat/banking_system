### Banking System

This is project is the coding task for mediusware ltd. I have used bootstrap for styling and it's very poor style as I only focused on the functionality of the project.

### Used
`PHP 8.1.0`, `Laravel 10` and some jquery packages as well as bootsrap for styling. 

### Step to run the project:
1. Download the repository
2. Setup the database in the .env file. Please rename the .env.example to .env or just copy the file. 
3. Update the composer 
4. Run: `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`
5. I already seeded 2 users. One for business type and another for individual user type. 
   1. Business type: email: business@gmail.com, password: business
   2. User type: email: user@gmail.com, password: user
